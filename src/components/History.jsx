                    <p>Our journey began a century ago when we started as a textile production house in India. Over the years, we have grown into a diversified group with a presence in multiple industries and sectors. Empire Industries Limited, with its repertoire of businesses, has established a strong market presence in the manufacture and marketing of machine tools, industrial equipment, glass bottles, business centers, integrated industrial and residential townships, frozen foods and vending machines.</p>
                <p>Empire Industries Limited., through its pioneering efforts, introduced the internationally understood concept of vending, in India. Grabbit + was launched with the vision to be the most preferred vending solution provider by making world-class, quality vending machines for corporate offices in India.</p>

<p>During the surge of Covid-19, individuals and communities were faced with the most difficult challenges. The economy was distraught as the supply of the most basic necessities was inaccessible. Grabbit+ saw this as an opportunity to contribute to the lives of many. Grabbit+ not only offered vending services during this time but also assisted institutions across the country in maintaining hygiene and creating a healthier, better and safer environment for its employees and visitors by making a range of health and hygiene solutions expediently available. This marked the beginning of the Health & Hygiene vertical, which is known for developing high-quality products and providing world-class services to its customers. Grabbit+ started contributing to the nationâ€™s hygiene and was committed to serving with the same dedication and excellence that have been our hallmark for a hundred years.</p>
